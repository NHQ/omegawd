// in the current scope *this* === that.obj. Not a surpise, but thems the scopes mang.

		delete that.obj;
//		delete this

//  	^^^^  You can't delete this scope while all up in this (itself), though doing so will delete it outside of its own scope
		
//		delete this.a; 

//  	^^^^	will delete this.a *within this scope* and outside of it

		console.log(that, this, that.obj, this.a) 
		
// not that.obj is undefined, while this, and this.a, are not, even tho we deleted 

//	the following will restore that.obj
//	that.obj = this;

//call the function and pass "this"
	this.obj.a(this)

// but now this.obj is underfined cuz we deleted it
	console.log(this.obj)
